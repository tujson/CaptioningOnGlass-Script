# Captioning On Glass - Script
https://cog.gatech.edu

- Manually stepping through a script. 
- On Google Glass, double tapping the touch panel/area switches scripts. On a phone, clicking the "Ready" text switches the script. 
- To advance the script, connect a presentation clicker and click either: left, right, or "b". 

This goes through a two step training task before proceeding to the main script.
